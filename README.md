## Who should speak at dsmJS?

* __First-time speakers__: meetups are a great way to get starting speaking
* __Seasoned speakers__: have a talk that you are preparing for a larger event? We'd
  love to hear it and give you a chance to practice before that event.
* __Anyone__: we're always looking for people from the local JS community to share
  their knowledge with us, so don't hesitate to tell us what you've been up to.

_Note_: If you'd like to give a talk, but don't have a topic in mind, browse the
[topic requests](https://github.com/dsmjs/talk-proposals/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22topic+request%22)
from other members.

## The process

This isn't intended to be overly formal, but you should expect something along the
lines of the following to occur:

1. __Propose a topic__: If you'd like to propose a topic for an upcoming meeting,
   please start the conversation with us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/dsmjs/talk-proposals/issues).

   Topics can be either something you'd like to share your knowledge about or
   something you'd like to learn about from someone else.
1. __The leads will respond__: We'll ask some follow up questions to
   understand how ready you are to give the talk and where it might fit in our
   monthly schedule.
1. __Publish details on the site__: Once a date is chosen, you can either submit
   the details about the talk in the thread, or you can submit the details as a
   PR to the site repo.
