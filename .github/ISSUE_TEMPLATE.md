## Topic

### Title

<!--
  do you have a name for the talk? if so, include it here.
  this could be used on the website, but does not need to be finalized now.
  you can adjust this as needed when we get closer to posting on the website.

### Summary

<!--
  give us an idea of what the talk will be about.
  don't worry about this being polished. we'll ask for clarification as needed

### Supporting Info

  have additional information that you would like to include? have links to
  slides/code/video? any of this information is totally optional and could
  be added after you give the presentation

## Scheduling

* is this a talk that you already have prepared or do you still need time to
  get it ready? how much time would you need to have it ready for a meeting?

* is this a practice run for a talk that you are giving at another event? if
  so, when is that event?

* would this talk work better as a lightning talk or as the only talk of the
  night?

* anything else that would help us decide an appropriate month?

* do you have a preferred hosting location?

## Presentation

* will you be presenting from a mac or windows machine? (this gives us an idea
  of what options are available to connect to the presentation equipment)

* are the ports available limited in any way?

* do you have your own adapters for connecting to a projector, etc?

## You

* would you like your name displayed the same as your github profile?

* do you have a twitter handle that you would like displayed on the site?
